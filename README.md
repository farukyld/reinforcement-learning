## Overview

Implement reinforcement learning algorithm to find policies for frozenlake environment.

Reinforcement learning algorithms implemented:

1. Model based tabular algorithms:
    * Policy iteration
    * Value iteration
    * Policy improvement
2. Model free tabular algorithms:
    * SARSA control
    * Q-learning control
3. Model free non-tabular algorithms:
    * SARSA control with Linear function approximation
    * Q-learning with Linear function approximation

## Requirements

Unzip the folder and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the required dependencies.

* python version should be 3.7 or above
* numpy version should be 1.19.2 or above
* matplotlib version should be 3.3.2 or above

## Execution

* Execute the ```main_implementation.py``` file to run the reinforcement learning algorithms on the environments.
* Execute the ```env\run_env.py``` file to manually run the environments.

## Explanation

* main_implementation displays the policy and values for the small frozenlake, comment out line 135 if you want to
  execute only for small frozenlake
* big_implementation displays the policy and values for the big frozenlake, comment out line 136 if you want to execute
  only for big frozenlake

## Data Collector

* Data collector is used to visualize the convergence of the algorithms.
* It computes mean squared error for value when compared to optimal value.
* It computes the classification error for policy when compared to optimal policy.
* Follow the below instructions to use data collector.

```
Add below to the algorithm to store the error for visualization.
    
    DataCollectorSingleton.instance().calculate_error("Algorithm name", policy, value)
   
Add the below to the main_implementation.py to visualize the errors

before running algorithms:

    DataCollectorSingleton.instance().set_optimal_policy_value("env name", "env optimal policy value path <.npy file>")
    
after running algorithms:

    plot_errors(*DataCollectorSingleton.instance().get_errors()) 
```
